Summary
-------

:code:`perturb-lib` is a library of tools for scalable modeling of biological perturbations from experimental data.
It provides an implementation of the *Large Perturbation Model (LPM)* from the paper "In silico biological discovery with Large Perturbation Models".
Furthermore, perturb-lib is a general framework that systematically collects data, embeddings, models, and evaluation tools useful for perturbation model.
It also includes :code:`perturb-gym` which is a suite for easily configurable and scalable training of perturbation models.
